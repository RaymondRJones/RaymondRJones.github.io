      <description>Programming Books
Cracking the Coding Interview
How much I&amp;rsquo;d Recommend it - 10/10
The book that introduced me to the world of interview problems. Has 150+ problems that will put you ahead of other candidates.
Elements of Programming Interviews Python
How much I&amp;rsquo;d Recommend it - 10/10
A book of even more problems than CTCI, AND they’re harder. I solved a lot of problems in this book, and I can easily say it helped on my interviews.</description>

      <description>Working Full TimeI’ve been living in my home-town in Pensacola since March. A few days ago I started working as a software developer for Citibank. Most of my days are spent at my computer desk, which is a shocking difference to what I’m used to. However, when Coronavirus ends, I might be moving into Tampa, having a more normal life. On the bright side, I can use my friends home gym and spend more time writing stuff like this.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that special, wonderful time of the year. Thousands of students wake up each month with a mixed sense of anxiety and excitement. When their classes end, they&amp;rsquo;ll go home and hear about how their friends got accepted into Duke and MIT, then they&amp;rsquo;ll schizophrenically debate with themselves whether they should check or not if they got into their dream school. I mean, if Thomas got in, then why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they?</description>
