**On Creativity**

I was walking to a salsa event with one of my friends. She told me how, as a photographer, I’m probably used to being isolated to work on projects. I was confused. 

I’ve don’t consider myself a creative person. I like making jokes and writing semi-interesting stories, but it’s never felt *creative*. It wasn’t until I started reading [Big Magic](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond/dp/1594634726/ref=asc_df_1594634726/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312025908234&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16705823688180681276&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011813&hvtargid=pla-434114243271&psc=1) that I started wondering what creativity means to me.

I told my friend that I’m most definitely not a photographer. I mean, me? A photograahper? Sure, I have 500 photos that I’ve taken of various photo subjects. Sure, I've spent hours studying composition. I have a fancy camera and studio lights at my house. I have a fancy little back-drop. Oh no, no, no. I can't be a photographer.

Don't worry I'm as confused as she probably was. I needed to think about why I didn’t want to be considered a photographer. 

Although I enjoy taking pictures of people and making them look as amazing as can be, I just couldn’t see myself as a “photographer”. Perhaps because I hardly consider myself a writer. And only consider myself a programmer because I officially have a job for it. But these "titles" are all arbitrary.

I want to start considering myself a photographer, a writer, and a programmer. I want it to be part of my identity. A simple addition to give myself confidence on my journey to creativity.

Don't be surprised if my LinkedIn tagline is: 

*Writer, Programmer, Photographer, Youtube Content Creator, Poker Player*

**Being Creative**

You may be wondering, “Why do you care about any of this stuff”

Art has profoundly impacted my life. There are movies that have changed my entire perspective on life, and imagining that some 20 year old had an idea for a story that can be turn around someone's life is wonderful for me. I want to have that effect on another person.

AIt's not just movies, I started this rabbit hole with books. I’ve read so many revolutionary books, and it was all made by some person who decided “I think this would be a cool idea. I'll write about it”

It required saying something, or trying something, that had never been done before and simply hoping it would work out because you think it’ll work out. It’s the part of creativity that I respect.

This is my call for creativity. For not just myself, but to whoever is reading this. I urge you to move towards some idea. Whether you have ideas for dancing or writing or making music or designing. If you have the idea, try it out. 

In my case, I can't improve as a writer unless I write. I can't improve in photography unless I try new ways that I can take photos. I don't have any goal for these. I just want to learn interesting skills and make some cool things.

Photography was always sort of a means to an end for this. Learning basic composition rules helps me create better video recordings and also create better photography. Learning the camera settings like Aperture, shutter speed, and iso helps me use when I want to delve into film making.

And of course, film is intertwined with making Youtube videos, especially when composition, lighting, and editing are so involved with a creation.

**A Final Note**

Now, I'm more confident calling myself a writer or photographer. Sure, I’m constantly stuck thinking about my friend who constantly takes photos and sets up dates to shoot with people. And I fundamentally know that I won’t be as good of a photographer as him, simply because I don’t care enough to spend time on photoshoots.

However, I don't have the luxury to compare myself to other people. The better option is to just work on creating and building a creative lifestyle.
