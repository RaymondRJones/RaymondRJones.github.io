It's that special, wonderful time of the year. Thousands of students wake up each month with a mixed sense of anxiety and excitement. When their classes end, they'll go home and hear about how their friends got accepted into Duke and MIT, then they'll schizophrenically debate with themselves whether they should check or not if they got into their dream school. I mean, if Thomas got in, then why shouldn't they? 

Heart beats increase and somehow they've managed to incorrectly enter their password for the third time. Time seems to slow down at the apparently grandiose task of reading a letter. Eyes constantly scan words for the famous indictors, like "Congratulations" or "We're sorry..". If you get in, great, your life is a little less complicated, but what if you don't get in?

Hundreds of thousands of students are applying to colleges, and it's a fact that not all of them will get in. And not getting in sucks, it's the college saying that you weren't the right one for them. But I've been saying for years that college choice is pretty irrelevant to your overall life plan. Along with that, I think a significant part of college admissions depends on chance. Because of that thinking, I'm much less invested in the outcome of my colleges and much less nervous on the outcome.

"Well Raymond, college is everything. If you think like that, you probably won't go anywhere good or do anything good"


It's extremely unlikely that because someone attends the University of South Florida over the University of Florida that they'll be utter garbage and the muck of society. Because getting into both of those places is great, and the benefits plateau as you rise into more competitive colleges. Florida State University has six Noble prize winners, and Cornell University has three, so is Cornell really pushing out the new Einstein's of our era?

I get it, you wanted to make all your friends jealous and tell Jimmy to go suck it. You wanted to make your parents proud so they can brag to their friends. But, when is the standards of other people, better than our own dreams?

Or maybe, you figured that college decisions would be a perfect test of yourself worth as a human being. Maybe, slowly and steadily, you began to see college admissions and some perfect and errorless test of your intelligence. Colleges receive applications from thousands of applicants and each of those individual people have their own dreams and goals, just like you. A few of them have the same GPA and SAT scores as you with small differences in extracurriculars. This makes choosing "the best" applicants really hard, and sometimes, you're rejected because you like airplanes, and they want someone who likes painting. When you have the scores of the 50% of people applying, it's basically a crap shoot whether you're getting in or not. Just because you got in, doesn't mean you're a beast, and if you didn't get in, you're not awful. Like chance, it just happens, and you're just there.

If you get into a good school and want to celebrate, that's great. Let's start popping bottles. However, I wrote this as some weird message to the people who didn't get the dream school, because it will invariably happen to someone. And when it does happen, maybe their world will be turned upside down, but I want them to know that it's okay. Failure is going to come time and time again. Now is the best time to start embracing it.
