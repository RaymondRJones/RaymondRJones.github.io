A Random Walk Down Wall Street <br>

Mastering Small Stakes No Limit Hold'em<br>
(*How much I'd Recommend it - 9/10*)

If you don't play poker ignore this. If you're trying to be a good poker player, this book is an amazing introduction into exploitative play. A lot of people have said that poker teaches great life lessons, and from learning how to play, I can wholeheartedly agree. You learn to control your emotions and understand that sometimes life doesn't go your way.

Mental Game of Poker<br>
(*How much I'd Recommend it - 5/10*)

There are better psychology books out there. This book was just a repeat of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy concepts, but it was interesting. I wouldn't strongly recommend it, and instead, I would point you towards CBT books.
