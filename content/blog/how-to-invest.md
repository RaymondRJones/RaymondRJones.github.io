I’ve heard people describe investing as complicated or scary. I wanted to change that. I’ve read like 5 different finance books, and I like money. I end up telling my friends this stuff because I think it’s interesting. Also, investing late, or worse, never investing, can easily lose $100,000+ in gains. 

Warren Buffet and most financial advisors agree that a lifecycle fund or an index fund is the best way to invest as a beginner. An index fund is ownership in each company of a market. Basically, you invest in the economy as a whole. This is cool because since the beginning of time, the market has done amazing. The exact yield can range from is 6-10% each year. At 6%, if you invest $10,000 every year, you have $140,000 in 10 years. Add another 10 years, you have $390,000. Add another 10 years, you have ~$1 million. This is rapid growth is why you need to invest NOW.

Index funds are perfect for beginners because you don’t need to analyze a business. You only need to click buy, and the market will do all the work. A professor won a Nobel prize for mentioning this amazing strategy.

He analyzed the stock choices of professional managers and compared it to the market. Most of the pros struggled to outperform the market. This was a bad look for the fancy managers. They charged big commission rates that cut into even more of client’s profits, not to mention that you apparently need one of the best to even beat the market.

I could keep talking but that’s another story. 

That’s all there is to it if you’re a beginner. Quite literally, It take ~30 seconds to open an account, go to an index fund, and click buy. Wait, and on average, you’re going to have a lot of money. In the worst case, the economy becomes non-existent, and we’re using bananas as the national currency.

I’ve had my friends do this in 2018, and the market went up around like 10%. Another friend bought shares when the market collapsed from Coronavirus, and now it’s up like 40% or something. 

That’s investing 101. I tried to make an EXTREMELY complicated subject into something very simple, so if there’s any questions feel free to ask me   
**TLDR**

2.	Click Open Account, fill out your name and etc.
3.	If Schwab, click buy SWRPX or S&P500 Index
4.	Sit Back and do better than 90% of people flailing around in the stock market
