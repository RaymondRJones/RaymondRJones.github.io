**Working Full Time**

I’ve been developing software for Citibank since August. Most of my days are spent at my computer desk, which is a shocking difference to what I’m used to. Their office won’t be opening until March, so I might just live with my parents and save money until then.

**Improving Cardio**

 I’ve been running probably the most since I was in high school, and I can thank David Goggins for motivating me for that. I’ve also been stretching, and I’m probably the most flexible than I’ve ever been. 

**Improving Writing**

I write maybe 10,000 words every week, and I share very little of it. I enjoy writing, and I hate sharing it. Which is odd because I guess it should be something people want to read if I don’t mind reading it. Rather than be a stereotypical shut-in nerd whose socially inept, I’d like to improve my communication skills. So, I’ll try publicly sharing some of the things I write at the end of the week. 

**Learning Korean**

I meet up with language tutors about 3 times per week. And outside of that, I try to listen to 

**Photography**

I decided to learn portrait photography. I bought a fancy camera, and I’ve been playing around with different shots with it. Most of my time has been spent studying other photographs and listening to professional photographer’s tips.
