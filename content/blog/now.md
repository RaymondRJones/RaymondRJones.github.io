I’m currently living and working in Orlando. Being vaccinated means I can start shifting my old hobbies of being inside all day to having more social opportunities. 

**Working Full Time**

I’ve been working as a developer at Citibank for a year. I’m also trying to solve every problem in the ELPI book. I think I’m at about 50 out of 200. 

**Getting Back into Weightlifting**

 The pandemic meant not lifting weights for a year, so I’ve been following a schedule to bring my strength back to where it used to be.  

**Dancing Classes**

I used to dance a lot. And now, I get to continue doing it. Aside from being a fun way to spend my weekends, it’s also a nice way for me to meet new people in the Orlando area. 

**Photography**

I’ve been taking around 100 photos every weekend. It’s been really cool to practice and think about composition of photos. And my entire view of how I see images and the effects they bring on the mind have significantly changed since practicing it.

**Solving Algorithm Problems**

I'm still occasionally solving algorithm problems on the weekends. I want to keep my programming skills sharp, and this is a necessary component of that.
