<p>Dosha</p>
<p>I’ve always enjoyed taking personality tests. I like things that help me better understand myself, and this shouldn’t be a surprise because I have a blog dedicated to reflecting and musings.</p>
<p>I recently heard Dr.K talk about how it’s important to understand your Dosha. Or maybe he didn’t say that, but rather, that Doshas can be a good way to understand yourself. In his case, understanding that he was Vata meant going from a failing student to Harvard psychiatrist. So, I decided to try it out.</p>
<p>Our society puts people into general buckets where we try to acclimate everyone into one thing. In school, we teach everyone the same. The people who can’t fit that mold are told “Hey, sucks to suck” and given bad grades. Or if they’re special, they’re given a handful of pills and told that they’re just broken.</p>
<p>For these people, Dr. K thinks there’s a second option, an option where you don’t need to live your life like you don’t fit in. Instead, you can understand what your good at and what your bad at and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Enter the Dosha Quiz.</p>
<p><strong>My Results</strong></p>
<p>I was torn between what I would be. I have a medium body frame. I’m driven and argumentative, but I also think I’m pretty good at understanding opinions. I’m also very indecisive, and I’ll switch my hobbies like a day in the wind.</p>
<p>Because of this, I thought I was Pitta or maybe Vata. When I took the quiz, like a 6 for Pitta, 5 for Vata, and 4 for Kapha. So, it would suggest that my theory was maybe right. That I’m some mix of Pitta and Vata.</p>
<p><strong>What This Means</strong></p>
<p>I have an extremely basic knowledge of what this means.</p>
<p>Maybe, I need to practice my weaker edges like being less argumentative or being better at understanding opinion. Or being a Vata, maybe I get bored doing 1 thing for a long time easily, so it’d be a good idea to switch things up so I’m not bored.</p>
<p>Maybe I could fill my weekday with things to do, so I’m able to switch and not get bored and start watching television or something. In school, I think my focus was best when I could go to the gym, go to some club meetings, talk to different people, and then go home to switch into work mode. Since graduating and losing this entire routine, my productivity has dropped a lot.</p>
<p>This is part of why I loved Pomodoros in college too. Basically, you work for an hour, and then you take a break for like 10 minutes. This worked very well for me, and most times I was able to get a lot of work done.</p>
<p><strong>The Diet</strong></p>
<p>Vatas are supposed to eat warm and moist foods. Whereas Pitas are supposed to eat cold and dry foods. This distinct conflict really makes me wonder. I don’t think I’ve ever only eaten cold foods, but I don’t think I’d be very happy doing it. If I had to guess, I’d be more comfortable following the Vata way, but I won’t know until I try.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Conclude This Thing</strong></p>
<p>Understanding yourself is a very important skill in life. When you understand how your mind and body work, you understand it’s limits. Then, you can take action to improve your life overall. Ayurveda has been around for a long time, and I agree with Dr. K on the importance of understanding it.</p>
<p>So, I’d urge you to try taking the quiz and find out what Dosha you are. And maybe do a little bit of reading to understand what adjustments in life you should make to better follow your Dosha.</p>
<p>While I’m Vata-Pitta, I’m not sure how accurate or reliable or crazy doing Dosha’s will improve my life. But it gave me some hints to try.</p>
<p>I don’t think we can just follow someone general rules and guidelines for happiness and success. I think it comes from understanding yourself. So, I urge you to understand yourself better. Of course, you’ve got nothing to lose.</p>
