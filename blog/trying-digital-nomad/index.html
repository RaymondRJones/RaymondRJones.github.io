<p>I arrived in Costa Rica about 4 days ago, and it’s been an interesting experience. I sit down in a hotel with spotty Wifi getting about 1MB download speed. My video meetings sometimes lag, and my Tik Tok videos refuse to load occasionally. But it’s cool because I get to talk to people from different parts of the world.</p>
<p>I thought working while travelling would mean sipping pina coladas on a beach and feeling an overwhelming sense of happiness. But 4 days in, I don’t really have that. My life is just more interesting and stressful.</p>
<p>I have to force myself to speak Spanish when I want something or have a problem. But as a reward, I get become a more globalized person. I get to drive 5 minutes to a hot spring where I can relax for $10. Basically, I have the option of doing 20 different activities all within a 10 minute drive from each other. Things like rappelling or ziplining that would cost much more money and require much more time in the US.</p>
<p>The big question I find myself asking is “Is this worth it?”</p>
<p>Is being able to meet people and speak another language worth living out of a backpack. Is it worth the dicey internet? And so far, I actually think it is.</p>
<p>Sure, I spend a lot of time working, but I also get to network and meet interesting travellers. This is something I don’t get in the USA. I’ve also been able to take some nice photos I think. And all of this is at the cost of some home cooked meals and stable connections. However, if I could redo this, maybe I wouldn’t have chosen Costa Rica. Maybe I would have chosen somewhere I’d feel comfortable walking around at night, something with not so many daytime activities.</p>
<p>I would have bought airpods instead of my more bulky headphones. And that’s actually everything I would change. I don’t mind working from hotel rooms. And I don’t mind feeling like I’m missing out on day time travelling because I have to work during the day. I wonder if next time, I’d be able to meet more digital nomads instead of the college backpackers and vacationers I’ve normally met.</p>
<p>What Comes Next
I’ve really enjoyed being a digital nomad for these 4 days. Yeah, it’s stressful, but most of my stress comes from being unsure whether my job will fall apart. I still want to do amazing work while being able to take a weekend to do some touristy stuff during the day.</p>
<p>If I were to do this again, I think I would just go straight to South Korea to live for 6 months and try to learn the language and work nocturnally. However, I’m still worried about my job, so I’m not sure if I’ll do this. But the idea sure sounds nice doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Also, another thing I enjoy is being a foreigner in a country. Oddly enough, It makes me feel special, and I like the feeling of it. Like, I feel like a more overall interesting person when I interact with other people. Although they don’t really ask me crazy questions, I still like the aura of it. And I wonder if it would help me with dating. But anyways, I’d  have to overcome my fear of asking women out for that anyways.</p>
