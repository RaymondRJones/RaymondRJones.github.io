<p><em>In 2015, I wrote a series of essays for college applications, and this might be one of my favorites because it summarizes my thoughts on life.</em></p>
<p>I left my house and started running my usual route. I passed houses and continued to follow the white, concrete pavement until I arrived at the park. Jogging there was the warmup, and the actual workout would begin at the park. I started sprinting up and down a field until breathing became a struggle. I decided to try a new exercise, parkour. I ran towards a tree and kicked my leg out at an angle to propel my body upwards for vertical distance. I practiced the technique over and over, until something happened.</p>
<p>In my exhaustion, I sprinted towards the tree and jumped to kick my leg out, but I missed the tree with my lead leg. My other leg followed through with momentum, and my knee smashed against the tree. I fell on the ground and saw the skin torn off. I saw the blood that began to flow. With the blood, came the pain and with the pain came limping. I hobbled back home on that same concrete pathway and looked at those same houses. I was alone, in pain.</p>
<p>I never went to the doctor for my knee, but there&rsquo;s a scar. At least once a week, it itches throughout the day, and I&rsquo;m sometimes scared that it&rsquo;ll never truly heal. What started out as some ambitious, youthful project quickly turned into a failure that could permanently damage my life because I was too negligent. I don&rsquo;t regret the failure because it taught me lessons.</p>
<p>When I exercise, I think about the scar on my knee, and I see it as an example of how pain can&rsquo;t tear me down. It&rsquo;s an example that pain doesn&rsquo;t have to be something avoided at all costs. Pain can be good, and it can allow the body and mind to grow. In my disappointing case, my knee has a scar, but I can still run faster and lift more weight with that scar. The scar doesn&rsquo;t mean that I can&rsquo;t grow. In another example, IB classes can make me feel like I&rsquo;m breaking, but I can arise stronger afterwards.</p>
<p>Smashing my knee against a tree is something that could hurt my plans for running, learning Brazilian Jiu Jitusu, or just not having aching legs when I&rsquo;m in my 70s. In some respects, I learned not to push my body as hard and to be patient when it comes to working on activities. In other respects, I learned to appreciate the pain that&rsquo;s involved in this wonderful thing that we call life. Also, I learned to exercise caution against woody perennials.</p>
<p>These lessons in pain influence the my future projects. As of now, I&rsquo;ve taken a break from jumping at trees and replaced it with other projects. For my CAS project, I worked towards creating a popular student-advice blog. It involves working consistently to develop new topics for writing while fighting a blinking cursor. It involves pushing my writing to my friends hoping they care. I have to embrace the pain that comes with each obstacle.</p>
<p>When I had to limp upstairs at school I was reminded of these lessons. Every step was a reminder of my failure; however, I chose to see it as a challenge to keep moving forward. Also, I still had homework to do.</p>
