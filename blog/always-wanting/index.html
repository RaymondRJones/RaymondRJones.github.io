<p><strong>Hedonic Treadmill</strong></p>
<p>When I was younger I loved this idea called the Hedonic Treadmill. Eventually it became part of my core life philosophy. For the uninitiated, it’s a psychological theory that suggests humans constantly want things. And when they get what they want, they just want more of that.</p>
<p>Take drug use for example. Using a drug feels good the first time. After using it, your body adapts to it, and then, you need more and more of the drug to reach the same high. People can be light-weight alcoholics, but become heavy-weight by simply drinking more. The body adapts, and eventually 1 drink isn&rsquo;t enough to get them lit.</p>
<p>However, our minds are vastly more complicated than our bodies, so the hedonic treadmill&rsquo;s existence becomes sort of a philosophical question.</p>
<p><strong>People Who Want Everything</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally, I’ll meet people who are obsessed with money. They’ll relentlessly save their money. They’ll work long hours with hopes of buying a big house one day. They think of ways to earn more money and try to maximize their potential. There’s nothing wrong with this. Money is great after all.</p>
<p>But I’m stuck wondering if there’s ever too much money? Is there ever an end? And I’m not the only one thinking this.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-Lessons-Happiness/dp/B08D9WJ9G8/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Psychology+of+money&amp;qid=1627740507&amp;sr=8-3">Psychology of Money</a> explored this idea. It was also lightly applied in Robert Kiyosaki&rsquo;s idea of the <a href="https://www.richdad.com/power-of-play-to-escape-the-rat-race#:~:text=In%20my%20book%2C%20Rich%20Dad,to%20try%20and%20get%20ahead.">The Rat Race</a> 
, and also the culture in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses">USA of Keeping up with the Joneses</a>. To summarize, due to high consumerism in the USA, people are finding themselves constantly wanting to buy things, convinced it’ll make them happier.</p>
<p>People in the US generally don&rsquo;t <a href="RaymondJones.dev/how-to-invest">invest enough money</a>, while also racking up lots of debt. All for the thoughts of a bigger house and a fancier car to be better than their peers. What this means is most middle-class families spend more than they need to, and ultimately <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011216/average-retirement-savings-age-2016.asp">don’t save for retirement</a>. Then, they turn 70 years old and find retirement being a nice idea but having no way of doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Competition in the Workplace</strong></p>
<p>This doesn’t just have to do with personal finance, Prioritizing money affects job opprotunity. In the programming field, <a href="Teamblind.com">TeamBlind</a> is a popular website that epitomizes a love of money. It’s a community of individuals who have placed money above everything. They constantly talk and strategize about negotiations and interview preparation. They’ll drop their salaries and ask if they could get more.</p>
<p>The basics of being a true member of TeamBlind is that you focus on TC (Total Compensation). Company culture doesn’t matter. The project you work on doesn’t matter. Just pick the job that has the most  prestige or the highest total compensation package. The result is that this community is effective at making money. Although, I always wonder about how happy their lives are.</p>
<p><strong>Siddhartha</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, like most life philosophy, we don’t have an answer to this question. Obviously, people can make money and be unhappy. But does money bring happiness? Is that the meaning of life?</p>
<p>People in the USA should be happier than countries where the median income is lower. But, I’m unaware of studies that say this. In fact, countries like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/asia/japan-suicide-women-covid-dst-intl-hnk/index.html">Japan</a> and Korea boast the highest rates of suicide despite their high economic advancement. People who win the lottery are generally just as happy the year after. People who become disabled are generally just as happy the year after.</p>
<p>Not to mention how hard happiness is to graph out and compare among people. How do you know if you&rsquo;re happier than Joe Schmoe?</p>
<p>When it comes to answering the question, there’s a couple of books. One of my favorites is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Siddhartha-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe-Hermann/dp/0142437182/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=siddhartha&amp;qid=1627741098&amp;sr=8-4">Siddhartha</a>. It’s a story about a man who tries to find happiness in life. He starts with Buddhism but leaves it after not finding it fulfilling. Then he sees, Asceticism, a community of people who preach that happiness is based on removing all external things. He joins them. He becomes homeless and starves himself. Once again, he realizes that this isn&rsquo;t helping him.</p>
<p>He eventually moves to another town and joins the material world. He becomes a high earning businessman with a hot wife. But he still feels like he’s missing something. By the end of his story, he realizes that none of these ways of life gave him an answer. What mattered was the journey. And at this time he finds the thing he was looking for all this time.</p>
<p>I bring up this story because I obviously preach individuality and freedom on my blog. And Siddhartha is part of why I enjoy the idea so much. For him, he needed to find his journey himself, there was no short cut or cheat. Nobody could give him an answer.</p>
<p>This is why I’ve been caring less about trying to push people towards different lifestyles. And why I encourage personal development and freedom. This is part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaDvRdLMkHs">Existentialism</a>, and if any of these sounds interesting it could be worth reading about.</p>
<p><strong>My Answer to the Question</strong></p>
<p>For me, money doesn’t really matter. And when people toss and turn in their sleep because they’re not millionaires at age 28, it’s very strange to me. Generally, we think of success as being a good thing, but I’ve met a lot of perfectionists, high stressed individuals who are amazingly successful. They’ll most certainly be millionaires in the upcoming years, and yet, they’re so much more stressed than me.</p>
<p>In college, they’d freak out about a bad grade or exams. And now, in the workplace, they freak out if they think they can make more money. When I look at them, I can’t imagine any amount of success that would remove the stress and worry from their lives.</p>
<p>This is also why I preach mental health so much and perhaps I should write an article about it. I think finding happiness involves introspection and being aware of one’s own mental state. Meditation helps with this.
With depression and anxiety rising over the years, I wonder if people will start adopting these strategies.</p>
<p>For me, it just makes sense that if there’s a mental problem, you fix your mind. Anyways, ultimately, that’s up for them to decide.</p>
