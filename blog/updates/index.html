<p><strong>Where I’ve Been</strong></p>
<p>It’s been 8 months since I’ve last publicly written something. And the time really flew by quickly, since November 2020, I’m not really sure what I’ve been doing. In January, I started becoming involved with political discussion, and I would listen to Destiny debate various topics. At the same time, I was intensely studying poker to improve my ability in the game. And overall, I think the year of poker was a decent success, although I’ll save that story for another day.</p>
<p>And finally, for the past 2 months, I’ve been studying photography and a little film making while also enjoying being able to live the house for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>I’ll usually spend like 5+ hours a week dancing salsa and practicing different moves, and overall it’s been a good way to spend my time. However, there’s still problems that I have.</p>
<p><strong>A New Direction for the Blog?</strong></p>
<p>I’m constantly thinking about new ideas, usually after reading it in a book that’s 300 pages long. And then, I’ll tell these cool ideas to my friends in about 5 sentences, and they’ll tell me how dumb it sounds. And I’ll spend a large amount of time explaining the other 299 pages until they eventually come around or they give up. This process happens all the time, and it’s quite annoying. So, I wonder if I could just have a place to publicly put my ideas and tell stories from software development.</p>
<p>Along with this, listening to so much political debate has given me a lot more confidence in defending my various beliefs in general, so I don’t think I’ll feel as ashamed publicly sharing them. I don’t really have any goal with this blog except having a location to publicly share my ideas and experiences.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Improve at Something</strong></p>
<p>When I was in high school, I was quite bad at writing. My sentences had grammatical mistakes. There wasn’t an understandable flow to the words I would say. And I had a lot of unnecessary words in my essays. As a result of all of this, I never got amazing grades when I wrote an essay.</p>
<p>Two things helped me improve my writing. 1.) I wrote a lot. I would write every single day about anything that came to my mind. It helped me develop a voice, and rereading my words helped me changed what I didn’t like about my writing. Overall, I expect that writing words just became more effortless. 2.) I would read my criticism. When my teachers would write notes on what I made mistakes on I would listen and actively avoid making those mistakes the next time. 2 years later, I was applying to colleges and writing great essays for my SAT’s. The same writing that was sub-bar on my 2014 SAT was outstanding on my 2015 SATs.</p>
<p>I mention this story because I believe these two elements are how we improve at anything. And I could tell this same story with anything I was bad at when I was younger. Whether it’s programming, salsa dancing, poker, or Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, doing these two things led to me becoming pretty good.</p>
<p>So, when I constantly debate people, I feel like I’m improving at arguing. And when I’m thinking of ways to become good at photography or dating, the obvious decision is to take more photos and go on more dates.</p>
<p>I bring this up because so many people wonder “Wow, how can I get better at X”, and they either rarely engage with the activity or they never bother learning from their mistakes.</p>
<p>So, I’ll be spending my time trying to write more to improve my writing even further. And trying to find people to debate. And taking more photos so I can practice and improve my ability to capture moments in time. And I would hope you do the same if you’re trying to improve in some area of your life.</p>
