<p>I had a turning point at 12 years old where I was obsessed with growth. I realized that I could stop getting C’s and B’s if I studied by reading the book beforehand. I realized that I could run faster if I practice running faster. This never stopped.</p>
<p>In 10th grade, I convinced myself that I wanted to learn Spanish. I would talk to any Spanish person I could find. The internet was amazing for this. I would watch shows like Telenovelas and try to improve and improve. By 11th grade, I was considered the kid who was good at Spanish. And now, I can talk to anyone in Spanish.</p>
<p>A year after that, I scored 60th percentile on the SAT. I convinced myself that I needed to study to get better. I took the SAT again and got 84th percentile. With that, I was ready to start applying to colleges.</p>
<p>In college, I needed another challenge. I was never amazing at math, but I was going to teach myself calculus. I remember I told my friend that I was thinking of taking Calculus 1 at UF. He told me there was no way.</p>
<p>But I convinced myself that I loved programming and needed to study computer science (A math heavy curriculum). I spent the next year in hell. I sat in a classroom filled with students who studied calculus for 2+ years. I needed to go beyond (plus ultra). I had to use tutoring and lecture videos online, and even then, I’d still feel behind everyone. But I succeeded. I never failed a math class. I had taught myself calculus.</p>
<p>Outside of college, I need a new challenge. So now, we are in the era of Leetcode.</p>
<h2>I Did Leetcode Everyday for 40 Days </h2>
<p><img src="/static/leetcode.png" alt="Example image"></p>
<p>The past 40 days have been some of the most fun I’ve had in a long time. It’s also been extremely stressful and difficult. I’ve wanted to write about it, but I’ve been so busy solving problems every waking moment I’m able to.</p>
<p>I did this challenge for two reasons. One, I don’t have any other challenge to do. I’m bored, and I want to improve at programming. Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms is a way to do that. And two, there’s massive financial benefits to studying these problems. Now let’s talk about things I’ve noticed.</p>
<h3>Things I’ve Noticed </h3>
<p>I dream a lot about problems and how to solve them. During the first month, I was obsessively trying to solve problems and I wanted to keep every single one of them in my memory.</p>
<p>I can see so many different patterns. I feel like I can deconstruct the building blocks of code so much easier. I’m confident that if I can explain an algorithm, then I can code it without bugs. If there was a bug, it was introduced when I first explained the algorithm.</p>
<p>I’m so much better at python and understanding it’s libraries. A big part of python is keeping the code clean and concise. And everyday I learn more.</p>
<p>Related to patterns, Leetcode “hard” problems don’t seem like impossible, insurmountable beasts. They seem to be composed of like 3 to 5 patterns, whereas a medium will have 1 to 3 patterns.</p>
<p>Code complexity matters. There are solutions that work, but they’re impossible to implement in a 30 minute setting. When I consider two algorithms, I also think about how hard one would be to implement. If one requires writing an extra class or using a nested loop, it adds to the complexity and could introduce a bug.</p>
<p>Knowing patterns also means knowing common ways to reduce bugs in the code. One of my favorite of these is a “directions” array. Instead of using 10 lines to point to <code>Up</code>,<code>Down</code>,<code>Left</code>, and <code>Right</code> in an array, an array and loop can be used to iterate over these four directions.</p>
<p>Overall I feel more creative and confident when solving problems. When I look at my old code before this challenge, I cringe and think “Wow, that was so unnecessary”. It’s easier for me to break down the code. It’s easier for me to come up with ideas when I don’t have to consider so many unknown patterns.</p>
<p>And finally, I still have a long ways to go. Unfortunately, I’m close, but not quite there yet. Ideally, I’d be better than 80% of people on the website, and I think I’m currently hovering at 50th percentile. Which isn’t bad at all. I’m pretty good. But I can be much better. The 1% solvers will get solutions in 5 minutes.</p>
<p>I’ll try to update again at the 90 day mark. I’ll have solved 50 problems on the low end, and 100 problems on the high end of that. And from those, I should acquire even more patterns and problem solving abilities. So, here’s to another chapter.</p>
