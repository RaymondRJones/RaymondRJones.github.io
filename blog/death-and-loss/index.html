<p>Two months ago, my grandma passed away. I wanted to write and share something about it. I wanted to write something that would help other people when someone they care about disappears forever. But I never had the opportunity, I was too busy studying algorithms to pass job interviews.</p>
<p>A lot has happened in the past 2 months though, and her passing away has surprised me in a lot of ways.</p>
<h2>The Loss of my grandma </h2>
<p>The most obvious of this was the loss of my grandma. It’s a weird thing to lose someone you love. I’ve never actually lost someone I’ve cared about before. It’s a surreal experience to permanently lose someone. And to think about how they’ll never ever come back. The only things that exist of my grandma are memories, and soon, those will fade.</p>
<p>It reminds me of how I’ll eventually be dead. But before that, my mom, my dad, and likely a good portion of my friends will be. It’ll be just as sad, but maybe my life can be better. Because I’ll know to cherish every moment, because it might not happen again.</p>
<h2> The Loss of My Family </h2>
<p>The passing of my grandma also marks a big change in my family&rsquo;s dynamics. Cousins and distant relatives all traveled to be there for her funeral. And it’ll likely be the last time such a large family gathering happens. And inside my close relatives, a big fight occurred over what should happen for her funeral. Led by my mother and backed by my sister, the funeral was frozen until my aunt would relinquish control of the funeral to them. This damaged the relationship between my aunt and mother. And the entire sequence of events almost decimated my sister and aunt&rsquo;s relationship.</p>
<p>Sitting here with a broken family, now I don’t have a reason to go to Pensacola. Which is fine, I’m sure there will be renewal and rekindling as time passes. But for now, her death has marked damage to the entire family structure.</p>
<h2> Moving Forward </h2>
<p>With this said, I wanted to talk about my thoughts moving forward.</p>
<p>It’s been weird thinking of how I’ll never see my grandmother’s face again. How, I’ll never hear her voice. It seems almost unfair, like a cruel twist of fate. But it is actually just reality. Life can’t continue forever. And everything will vanish at some point. Including my life.</p>
<p>I find it easy to cry when I think about her and my family. It’s like watching a tragic movie, where the end just makes you cry. But then, you remember that it’s not a movie. It’s your life, and you can’t control it. Or make it stop. You just have to keep watching.</p>
<p>My grandmother passing away taught me a lot about life. It made me realize every day that I’m losing something. I’m choosing something to enjoy. Something that I might never see again. I’m nearing the final moments where I’ll see my mom. And I’m nearing the final moments when I’ll see my sister (No matter how much she annoys me) and everyone else. And I’m okay acknowledging all of that.</p>
<p>I also realize I’m running on limited time to see my little sisters grow up and choose careers and be someone. And in a lot of ways, I think I think of them as my own children, although I have much less responsibility and control over their lives. But I care immensely about them. It’s a scary thing, and I understand how my mom can feel the same way about me.</p>
<p>My grandma&rsquo;s family will likely never be the same, But I suppose that’s just how life works out.</p>
