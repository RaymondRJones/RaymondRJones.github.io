<p>I have a list of the most influential people on my life since the 2020 pandemic hit. I found 3 people who’ve fundamentally changed who I am.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> The First </h3>
<p>The first is unexpected, but Juice Wrld. The entire concept of emo rap was foreign to me. Although Drake paved the way for rappers to talk about their feelings, Juice took it to another level. Where rap was supposed to be rapping about girls, drugs, and how many people you can kill. It suddenly became girls, drugs, and how sad you feel.</p>
<p>His music forced me to be in contact with my emotions more. If some guy can change the rap game so drastically, why wouldn’t I be able to talk about my emotions to a small group of people?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> The Second </h3>
<p>The second was Dr. K, Dr. K took it to another level. He’s a Harvard Psychiatrist who also streams sessions on YouTube. He taught me how to be introspective with my emotions and how to better understand my world view. I use his compassion and understanding when I talk to people. Now, disagreements aren’t nearly as terrible as I used to have, simply because I know how I can listen to another person and guide them without triggering an explosion.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> The Third </h3>
<p>And the third was Destiny. The entire reason for me writing this is him, and it started when I read an email that someone left him.</p>
<p><em>Hello, I’m hoping this goes to the YouTube named destiny. I wanted to let you know that this is a little bit delayed but that my son who is 17, credits you with being one of his biggest influences. He has work two elections, one at 16 and one at 17. He had an article in our local paper because he was the youngest poll worker in the history in our country. In his interview they ask him why he became interested and has become so politically active and he credits you.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s been a crazy year, involving him coming out to us, our family completely disowning him because of this. I have not watched much of your YouTube but because of how strong I see him being. I’m assuming this is also been influenced from what he had seen from you</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you</em></p>
<p>Destiny is a political debater on Twitch, and I’ve never felt more comfortable expressing myself than after listening to Destiny’s debates. For perhaps the first time in my life, I’m comfortable drawing boundaries and speaking up for myself when people say something hurtful.</p>
<p>I first noticed this when I was talking to a “friend”, and we disagreed on something. And she blew up on me and started calling me a bunch of mean names. I was shocked. I’d never had anything like that happen. Ever.
Another time, I was talking to a friend, and the same thing happened. They got angry and started berating me because I had a different idea than them. While these situations are “bad”, they’re the side effects of me expressing myself and my ideas more. Before this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, people would regularly make jokes at my expense. Racist jokes were common. I think someone made a joke about me being 3/5ths of a person when we were playing ultimate frisbee one time (Named after the Three-fifths Compromise. An agreement in 1787 that only three-fifths of a state’s slave population would count towards the overall population). Most of these jokes I didn’t care about. I’m really accepting of anyone, so it was easy for me to be friends with all of these people who said hurtful things. I didn’t even notice anything was wrong.</p>
<p>However, after watching Destiny, I realized that people can be wrong about ideas. And I realized that even famous political commentators don’t have a clue what’s going on. But even more importantly, I learned how to debate, and I started trying to understand how politics in the United States worked.</p>
<p>Anyways, I teared up hearing about the 17-year-old Destiny fan who felt motivated to start diving into his city’s local politics. I teared up hearing that his family now hates him for coming out. It affects me because it feels so similar to my life. Before listening to Destiny, I was okay with letting people tell me my ideas are stupid. And now, I understand that you can’t have a maximally positive change on the world without people hating you and thinking your stupid. People hated Martin Luther King and now almost everyone reveres him. In the same way, Destiny helped me decide that I’ll let my thoughts take me to my own accord.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>When 2020 hit, I didn’t know what direction I would land in life. I was on the apex of graduating, and my favorite artist, Juice Wrld had died weeks before. Through the pandemic I found LS strategy videos which led me to Dr. K explaining mental health to him. And a series of Dr. K videos led me to Destiny.</p>
<p>I’m so unbelievably grateful to have found all of these content creators. And I aspire to one day improve someone’s life in the same way that they’ve improve mine.</p>
