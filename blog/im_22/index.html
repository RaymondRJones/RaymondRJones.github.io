<p><em>Every year, I write a reflection on my birthday year. And generally, they all say, “this year was great and I love my friends”. That isn’t happening today. Today’s my 22nd birthday. The past year has easily been one of my worst, but don’t get me wrong, the past 3 months were some of the best of my life. I’m thankful for the interns I met. And I’m even more thankful for all my friends who I could spend time with on my birthday.</em></p>
<p>A day before my 22nd birthday, I was dealing with a crippling sense of hopelessness and depression. This year went almost nothing like I expected it would have. I somehow ended up with a car. I somehow ended up with an internship at the very last minute. I also got to visit my dad in D.C, and I even got to visit New York for a day. But that was only the unexpected, and awkwardly stressful good parts.</p>
<p>On the “holy shit, I never would have expected this bad side”. I failed 2 classes. I failed numerous technical interviews at big companies. I spent the start of my 21st recovering from rejection and generally anxious. My aunt died, causing my mom and family a good amount of grief. Two of my closest friends broke up, making me empathetically sad. At a low point in July, I managed to somehow become so socially anxious, that I was unable to eat for several days.</p>
<p>Ignoring how terrible of a year my 21st was for me, 2020 has gotta be my year right? After last year, I have no idea how it’ll turn. And I would say that last year has irrevocably changed me and how I see the world. My philosophy has changed.</p>
<p><strong>What Changed</strong></p>
<p>I read about 4 different books on relationships. And then I read a huge book about depression. So, I try to remember the things I learned from the relationship books. And I try to keep an eye out for depression. But I think knowing more about it can help me help other people if they’re struggling with it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change came from reading Everything is F*cked. It sort of sets a mentality of removing conditionality from everything in my life. And even beyond that, to forget about success and failure, and just go with the flow. It’s sort of this whole Siddharta approach to life, that I think is nice to adopt.</p>
<p>So, when I get my friend a gift, or tell my family I love them, I’m not doing it because I’m expecting it in return, only because I want to do it.</p>
<p>And maybe the biggest thing I learned was just getting back up after being defeated. I’m constantly wondering if I’m going too far, and if I should just give up. But I’m always reminded that, if I give up, I have a 0% chance of success. And I’m okay suffering just for a chance at maybe a 10% chance, maybe even more. Maybe life will kick the shit out of me and I’ll end up nowhere, but at least I tried.</p>
<p><strong>Future-Plans</strong></p>
<p>Professionally, I’m trying to get a graduate at the very least and take my job in Tampa. On the higher end goal, I want to work for a big tech company, so I’m studying almost every day on algorithms for job interviews.</p>
<p>I’m supposed to go to Japan and Korea. So, it makes so much sense for me to start studying Korean outside of class. Also, I wanted to start practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and hitting the gym so my body isn’t completely destroyed.</p>
<p>I also wanted to get a cat, or maybe just foster one so I don’t blow all of the money I made over the summer.</p>
<p><strong>And That’s All Folks</strong></p>
<p>Part of me is worried I don’t talk to my family enough, because honestly, I’m quite avoidant with them. I’m worried that I really need to see a foot doctor and I’m ignoring the inevitable. And I’m also worried that I need to see a therapist, possibly for social anxiety, or even the “flat affect”</p>
<p>But despite all these depressing ramblings, I’m fairly happy right now. I’m going to relax and maybe watch a couple game videos. I’ll go to the gym and study like I normally do. And I’ll send out a few phone calls to family. And then I’ll probably go out at some point.</p>
