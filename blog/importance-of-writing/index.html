<p>Writing was one of my favorite hobbies when I entered high school. Eventually, blogging became a close second. When I would have a spectacularly bad day, writing my thoughts out would immediately help clear my mind and make me feel better. When I had a crazy idea and wanted to expand on it, writing gave me a nice place to put the <a href="https://raymondjones.dev/blog/college-decision-day/">thoughts together</a>. When I wanted to just have fun and talk about some joke, I could do that through writing.</p>
<p>4 years later, I noticed my writing had improved drastically. Normally, I would get sub-par grades on writing assignments, but my teachers actually thought my writing was better. When I wrote for the SAT, I scored much higher than I did taking the PSAT a year before. It was almost like writing every day improved my writing abilities.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that writing for fun has allowed me to advance academically, evident from getting higher grades and standardized test scores on writing throughout the years.  And on a personal level, I think it’s made my writing more interesting. When I look back at my initial writing compared to now, I enjoy reading it. I have a voice, a unique style of telling a story.</p>
<p>I’m aiming this post at highlighting the importance of writing. And I think this is even more important if you’re in the engineering field, because so many engineers seem to not care about writing. Without good writing, you lose good communication in our internet world.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">  Inspiriation for This Post </h3>
<p>This software engineer whose been in the industry for 20 years <a href="https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/">wrote an article</a> about all the things he’s learned over the years. I enjoyed it. One point spoke to me a lot.</p>
<p><em>Software engineers should write regularly</em></p>
<p>It’s too common for me to either 1.) Hear about managers who have terrible communication or people skills or 2.) Hear about how my circle of software engineering friends despise writing and people. I’m not sure if this happens in other industries, or if the stereotypes of the introverted computer guy rings true.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to meet a computer science student whose a lone warrior. These people can be amazing at coding, but they leave behind writing or even communication skills. Yeah, they could knock out a single coding assignment quickly, but if you put them on a team, they hinder communication.</p>
<p>When someone doesn&rsquo;t write, they let the skill fade away, and as a result, they’re ability to communicate suffers. And when communication suffers, the overall productivity of the team suffers.</p>
<p>Writing doesn’t just mean putting words on a page. It means having a coherently flow of thoughts. Beyond that, a great writer can capture the attention of the reader and hold it. They can cut out all the unnecessary words and get to the point.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">  The Writing I do </h3>
<p>While I’ve written over 200,000 words for fun over the course of my life, I’ve slowed down dramatically since the pandemic occurred. Instead, I spend a crazy amount of time messaging on Discord. Part of me wants to say it’s helped my ability to write short bursts of sentences or even respond to quick texts, but I&rsquo;m just coping. I  tell myself it’s not all worthless though because I argue a lot which requires me to carefully choose which words to use and the effect that they&rsquo;ll have.</p>
<p>Other than Discord arguments, I try to privately write on an occasion. For this public blog, I’m stuck wondering what people would enjoy reading. I know that the best way to write is to simply put words out. And the fact that nobody except me reads these words means that I can really choose to write about anything. So maybe I will do exactly that in the future.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">  A Conclusion </h3>
<p>Writing is probably one of the most important skills I’ve learned in life. Writing allowed me to go to an amazing college for a cheap cost which eventually lead to me studying computer science. Beyond that, it’s helped me properly communicate with my team at work, and I personally think writing as a hobby has drastically improved my abilities.</p>
<p>So, I urge others to also try writing. Especially the engineers who forgo writing in place of video games and anime. I think this group has the most to gain from writing.</p>
