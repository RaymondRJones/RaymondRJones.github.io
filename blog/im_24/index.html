I’m 24
</h2>
<p><em>Yesterday was my 24th birthday. And for the past 4 years, I’ve written a reflection of my year. My 24th birthday will be no exception.</em></p>
<p>Since I was 15, most of my time was spent waking up, working, and then going to sleep. This year was wildly different. I worked the least amount in my life since I was 13 years old. I’ve decided that I don’t really like it.</p>
<p>With Coronavirus ravaging the world and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, I spent most of my time inside all day and living with my parents to save money. The lack of ability to leave my house meant that I was extremely unmotivated. I struggled to find meaning after graduating college. Due to isolation, this year of being alone meant having more self-reflection than I’d done in my entire life. It also meant spending a lot of time with my family.</p>
<p><strong>The Notable Parts</strong></p>
<p><em>A Changing World View</em></p>
<p>The biggest change in the past year is almost entirely intangible. My world view has drastically changed. I’m realizing that many things I thought were correct and true aren’t so clearly the case. For example, I thought it was perfectly okay for animal farms to exist. Now, I’m against it. I’m not so sure what gives humans the right to slaughter pigs, cows, and chickens in terribly inhumane ways (Maybe I’ll write about this later). A lot of this is philosophical, and there’s not necessarily a correct answer. But it’s just an example of something I thought was true, but may not be.</p>
<p>My confusion of the world started from all of the books I read in the past year. <em>Homo Deus, Sapiens, History of Marriage, Big Magic, Can’t Hurt Me, Exhalation, Biggest Bluff, and Very Important People</em>. These books total about 4000 pages in length, and it’d be impossible for me to summarize them in this little post but reading books on history and society changed how I view society and the world. And as a result, I find myself questioning my own beliefs more, like what beliefs do I owe to myself, or do I owe because of society? These are big questions that I may never answer.</p>
<p>The second part of my changing world view has been the result of deep diving into US politics. After George Floyd, I found myself consuming more and more political content, and all it’s done is make me more disillusioned with the world. I understand issues in our society and the two sides that argue against them much better, but this is covered in emotional and nonsensical beliefs that lead the two political spectrums in the USA. And uncovering all of it is exhausting.</p>
<p>The bright side of this is that I’ve also been debating a lot this year. I learned a lot about debate tactics and optics, learning how to present an argument in a way that’s more persuasive. And I think this will ultimately be a good thing. Along with writing on this blog, debating has increased my abilities to communicate with others.</p>
<p><em>The Poker Project</em></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time studying poker. I even started a little poker study group and we’d analyze hundreds of hands, and beyond that, I played over 50,000 hands of poker. Towards the end, I actually started winning online. The other good part was that poker taught me things about life as a result of feeling and studying what 60% chance of success really means. The downside was that I think I ran bad playing at the casino, and I’m now down a pretty penny. But I’ll continue studying and playing until I’m out of this hole.</p>
<p><em>Photography and Dancing</em></p>
<p>I improved drastically at taking photos. I understand composition a lot more, and I understand what it means to be creative a lot more. So, it’s a nice feeling, and it even translates to when I’m dancing salsa. Speaking of which, my dancing has improved a lot this past year too.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>To summarize, I got to spend a lot of time with my family this year. And I’ve grown a lot as a person this past year. But I’m left with a lot more unsolved question. But one thing that will change this upcoming year, I’m going to work on a lot more projects, as I’ve always done in the past. 
I didn’t get to work hard on programming too much, and I want to change that for the future. In most areas, I think my skills have grown at a slow pace. And while this has been an interesting year, I think I’m ready to start burning the fire and tackling big projects and working long and hard hours.</p>
<p>I want to drastically increase my programming abilities, specifically through web development. I have a couple of project ideas that I’ll try working on. Not to mention trying to solve 150 algorithm problems. And at the same time, I want to continue working on poker, and try to win $10,000 from the game. I think it’s entirely possible, and in fact, I could most certainly win $1000 from just grinding online 10NL games. 
And of course, there’s plenty more of concepts, stories, and documentation reviews to write about on this blog. 
Other than that, I don’t have any complaints, and I look forward to having more birthdays on this pretty little world.</p>
