<p>I managed to graduate college! And thus, I fulfilled a long lasting life goal, and you could even argue that this was my biggest goal in life. I worked hard day after day, and I failed and failed, but I never gave up. And I got a kickass well paying job lined up too. It was a very relaxed way to go through one of my last semesters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Got to spend a lot of time with friends</li>
<li>Learned a lot of Operating Systems after retaking the class and having to restudy the material</li>
<li>Went to Grace Hopper and loved the idea of a career fair</li>
<li>Fostered two amazing kittens</li>
<li>Hit new PRs in the gym</li>
<li>Learned beginner Korean</li>
<li>Got really good at solving algorithm problems</li>
<li>Learned enough to get flown out to California</li>
<li>Used my rage to write about how shitty job interviews are</li>
<li>Got to survive and understand my psyche during a Pandemic</li>
<li>Read a lot of books about finance and and grasping basics of the economy</li>
<li>Started working for a bank</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of it’s intangible, and to be fair, my writing this past year has been very limited. And it only started to pick up because I was locked in a house with nothing to keep except my thoughts. Terrible torture am I right?</p>
<p>Anyways, I suppose a lot of the highlights of my final year of college are lost. But, of course, there are things that will always be with me. The happiness I felt as I passed the final difficult class of my Computer science bachelors. The feeling of relief as I played Japanese pop in the car as I drove back to my apartment, and then would make a 5-hour drive back to Pensacola. Hours of tears in front a book while I was stressed because not understanding this information would mean I fail a class. It all came and went.</p>
<p>And this year, I was steadily making progress all around. I learned a lot about algorithms after studying almost every day. I learned a little bit of UX design and what it means to create a profitable business. I learned about investing and how to handle my personal finance and even my mom’s. I learned about cars and how to change oil and batteries and tires.</p>
<p>Quarantine meant sacrificing a good portion of my life, but it might have meant reaching elevation in other areas. Because I’ve finally had time to read so many books, there’s a lot of theoretical knowledge I’ve gained. It might have ruined my ability to maximize my gains, tour Japan, and overcome my anxiety, but it allowed me to empathize with reading and learn concrete information.</p>
<p><strong>A New Type of Socializing</strong></p>
<p>Being a homebody has meant substituting my socializing. In a lot of ways, I’ve reverted to my middle school habits. My lack of an attempt and desire to cook means that I eat more fast food. The fact that I can’t physically see my friends means that I use videogames and discord chats to keep up with them. Instead of seeing people face to face and forming connections “better”, I’m forced to interact with my coworkers through a screen.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I’m able to have just as effective of a connection through this screen, which is an entirely new experience for me. I started July not caring about my analyst class, but now, I’ve grown to enjoy spending time and talking with them.</p>
<p>And I’m more interested in how far this goes. For dating, does that mean I can form a strong connection just by messaging? I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>New Goals and A New Future</strong></p>
<p>Maybe the title was a little dramatic, but I’ve already written about this. Reading Goggins book opened my mind and made me realize that I’m not sure I want to spend my life being “average”. I want to reach a high level in something, and every day, I’m more convinced that it means improving my ability to write and improving my ability to solve algorithms and program.</p>
<p>These things might shift when quarantine ends, but when I’m stuck at home all day every day, this seems to be the logical choice for me.
