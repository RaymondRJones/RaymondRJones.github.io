<p>I got my first smartphone at 11 years old. It was a Android, a Sony Xperia Play.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/0JMAAOSwvclfjHln/s-l640.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>My amazing phone in 2009</em></p>
<p>I noticed that all of my friends were obsessed with Apple, and this trend never stopped. When I started college, I noticed people wouldn’t invite you to group chats unless you had an Iphone.</p>
<p>I didn’t care for texting, so I never really cared. Also, I loved the quality hardware and full device freedom that Android offered, like right to repair. However, 2 months ago, I switched to the dark side. Thank you Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>After owning an Android my entire life. Here are my thoughts after having an Iphone.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Switched</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, I’ve realized 2 things. The first being that most young people have Iphones. The second, that people seem to see Iphones as a status symbol. Having one means your part of the “cool” kids and not having one means you’re a loser. I’m actually quite confident that most Iphone users couldn’t tell you why they think the Iphone is better than an Android. But that’s a rant for another day.</p>
<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s why I think the Iphone is superior to Android. For most cases, it’s the best choice for a phone for young adults.</p>
<p><strong>What I Like About Iphones</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 4 things that the Iphone beats Android over</p>
<p><em>1.) Sending texts through Messenger / Wifi</em></p>
<p>Sending and receiving messages feels noticeably faster than my <em>Samsung Note 9</em>. Now, I think Google should have <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/imessage-vs-googles-new-texting-update-can-androids-messaging-app-take-on-apple/">fixed this</a>, but sending images and videos is still very seemless.</p>
<p>When I send a video on Android, I&rsquo;m unsure if it will deliver. And part of that might be my bias from using it before 2018, when SMS was a complete mess. But Apple embeds Tik Toks / Youtube videos, lets you react to certain messages, and it allows group chats without any awkward message timings. Android users have all had the situation when they send a group message and it individually messages it. Apple doesn&rsquo;t have this.</p>
<p><em>2.) App Optimizations</em></p>
<p>Despite having worse hardware, Apple devices outperform Android devices when using popular apps like Snapchat. This is because the businesses optimize their applications for Apple devices. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but it means that Apple just wins out. Sending messages or photos via Iphone means other people won&rsquo;t see quality degradation. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>Also, personally, I love the queue feature that Spotify for Apple devices has, where you can simply slide your finger to queue a song.</p>
<p><em>3.) Airdrop</em></p>
<p>You can do some cool tricks via Wifi with Iphones. You can share your wifi password with other users who try to connect by simply pressing a button on your phone. This is faster than needing to spell out the words for your guest out loud. And then there&rsquo;s Airdrop.</p>
<p>Sharing photos can happen so easily by simply selecting what you want to share, and then having another person request permission. This is great for anytime you&rsquo;re spending time with friends and have several group photos you want to share with several of different people.</p>
<p><em>4.) Having people shut up about how great their Iphone Is</em></p>
<p>Okay this is kind of a joke. I still have to hear Iphone users downtalk Androids. Consumerism is a powerful drug.</p>
<p>Anyways, I originally bought an Iphone to simply be added to more group chats. Since then, I&rsquo;ve had a couple friends play games with me on the Iphone. I&rsquo;ve sent some memes to other friends and tik toks embedded through iMessage. I&rsquo;ve even texted friends via wifi. But I&rsquo;ve only joined three group chats since having my Iphone. With all of this talk about the Iphone, I will mention a few things that I&rsquo;ll miss from Android.</p>
<p><strong>What I liked about Android</strong></p>
<p><em>1.) The feeling of being edgy and on the path less traveled</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no greater feeling than this. Having an Iphone means paying more money for a phone with worse hardware. For me, it seems like peak consumerism. It&rsquo;s spending money simply to spend money. And somehow, this culture has created all of the benefits above.</p>
<p>Going against the herd has it&rsquo;s downsides, and it means missing out on the features above, and maybe even the respect of certain savants in the Apple cult. But it might be worth it for some.</p>
<p><em>2.) Knowing I could have complete control over my phone, if I truly wanted</em></p>
<p>A strong selling point is that an Android device is basically a strong, handheld computer. You can program it do to a variety of tasks, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a bunch of ideas and trick people could modify it for.</p>
<p>If you want to customize your phone screen, it&rsquo;s entirely possible with Android. If you want to download Gameboy or Gamecube emulators, Android&rsquo;s have the hardware to run them and the user freedom to have them work.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Iphone Is Superior</strong></p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s for all of these reasons that the Iphone is the superior phone for young adults. If you&rsquo;re a young professional, I might even say it&rsquo;s a requirement to have an Iphone. In most scenarios, you won&rsquo;t need the freedom that Android brings, and instead, you can use the social capital that having an Iphone gives you.</p>
<p>This is still a complicated issue. If everyone were to follow my advice, then I would have to change it. But as it stands in 2021, having an Apple device has benefits.</p>
