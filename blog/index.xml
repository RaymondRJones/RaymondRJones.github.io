      <title>Why Writing is Important</title>

      <description>Writing was one of my favorite hobbies when I entered high school. Eventually, blogging became a close second. When I would have a spectacularly bad day, writing my thoughts out would immediately help clear my mind and make me feel better. When I had a crazy idea and wanted to expand on it, writing gave me a nice place to put the thoughts together. When I wanted to just have fun and talk about some joke, I could do that through writing.</description>

      <description>I have a list of the most influential people on my life since the 2020 pandemic hit. I found 3 people who’ve fundamentally changed who I am.
The First The first is unexpected, but Juice Wrld. The entire concept of emo rap was foreign to me. Although Drake paved the way for rappers to talk about their feelings, Juice took it to another level. Where rap was supposed to be rapping about girls, drugs, and how many people you can kill.</description>

      <description>I’m 24Yesterday was my 24th birthday. And for the past 4 years, I’ve written a reflection of my year. My 24th birthday will be no exception.
Since I was 15, most of my time was spent waking up, working, and then going to sleep. This year was wildly different. I worked the least amount in my life since I was 13 years old. I’ve decided that I don’t really like it.</description>

      <description>I got my first smartphone at 11 years old. It was a Android, a Sony Xperia Play.
My amazing phone in 2009
I noticed that all of my friends were obsessed with Apple, and this trend never stopped. When I started college, I noticed people wouldn’t invite you to group chats unless you had an Iphone.
I didn’t care for texting, so I never really cared. Also, I loved the quality hardware and full device freedom that Android offered, like right to repair.</description>

      <description>Hedonic Treadmill
When I was younger I loved this idea called the Hedonic Treadmill. Eventually it became part of my core life philosophy. For the uninitiated, it’s a psychological theory that suggests humans constantly want things. And when they get what they want, they just want more of that.
Take drug use for example. Using a drug feels good the first time. After using it, your body adapts to it, and then, you need more and more of the drug to reach the same high.</description>

      <description>Dosha
I’ve always enjoyed taking personality tests. I like things that help me better understand myself, and this shouldn’t be a surprise because I have a blog dedicated to reflecting and musings.
I recently heard Dr.K talk about how it’s important to understand your Dosha. Or maybe he didn’t say that, but rather, that Doshas can be a good way to understand yourself. In his case, understanding that he was Vata meant going from a failing student to Harvard psychiatrist.</description>

      <description>On Creativity
I was walking to a salsa event with one of my friends. She told me how, as a photographer, I’m probably used to being isolated to work on projects. I was confused.
I’ve don’t consider myself a creative person. I like making jokes and writing semi-interesting stories, but it’s never felt creative. It wasn’t until I started reading Big Magic that I started wondering what creativity means to me.</description>

      <description>In 2015, I wrote a series of essays for college applications, and this might be one of my favorites because it summarizes my thoughts on life.
I left my house and started running my usual route. I passed houses and continued to follow the white, concrete pavement until I arrived at the park. Jogging there was the warmup, and the actual workout would begin at the park. I started sprinting up and down a field until breathing became a struggle.</description>

      <description>Where I’ve Been
It’s been 8 months since I’ve last publicly written something. And the time really flew by quickly, since November 2020, I’m not really sure what I’ve been doing. In January, I started becoming involved with political discussion, and I would listen to Destiny debate various topics. At the same time, I was intensely studying poker to improve my ability in the game. And overall, I think the year of poker was a decent success, although I’ll save that story for another day.</description>

      <title>Coding with Raymond - How to Get Minecraft on a Chromebook</title>

      <description>I have two sisters that are in 6th grade. Because their brains are so malleable, I figured I’d introduce them into the first step of using computers, by playing Minecraft. In most cases, it’d be simple. Just buy Minecraft and tell them to download it. Unfortunately, this did not happen.
They told me they were using ChromeOS, which can’t run Minecraft. Everything was downhill from there. This is the cautionary tale of my journey to ChromeOS.</description>

      <title>I spent $50 trying to learn Korean on Italki</title>

      <description>UPDATE: I failed at this challenge and it exists now only as click-bait. I went to about 4 classes before ultitamtely giving up and probably watching television instead. But I think this could be a cool idea for a future challenge
Since August of 2019, I’ve been learning Korean. For longest time, I’ve wanted to continue learning it, but I’ve been woefully unmotivated. That’s changing today, and I’m going to invest $1000 towards being able to speak the language.</description>

      <description>I managed to graduate college! And thus, I fulfilled a long lasting life goal, and you could even argue that this was my biggest goal in life. I worked hard day after day, and I failed and failed, but I never gave up. And I got a kickass well paying job lined up too. It was a very relaxed way to go through one of my last semesters.
 Got to spend a lot of time with friends Learned a lot of Operating Systems after retaking the class and having to restudy the material Went to Grace Hopper and loved the idea of a career fair Fostered two amazing kittens Hit new PRs in the gym Learned beginner Korean Got really good at solving algorithm problems Learned enough to get flown out to California Used my rage to write about how shitty job interviews are Got to survive and understand my psyche during a Pandemic Read a lot of books about finance and and grasping basics of the economy Started working for a bank  A lot of it’s intangible, and to be fair, my writing this past year has been very limited.</description>

      <title>How to Invest</title>
      <link>https://example.org/blog/how-to-invest/</link>

      <description>I’ve heard people describe investing as complicated or scary. I wanted to change that. I’ve read like 5 different finance books, and I like money. I end up telling my friends this stuff because I think it’s interesting. Also, investing late, or worse, never investing, can easily lose $100,000+ in gains.
Warren Buffet and most financial advisors agree that a lifecycle fund or an index fund is the best way to invest as a beginner.</description>

      <description>Programming Books
Cracking the Coding Interview
How much I&amp;rsquo;d Recommend it - 10/10
The book that introduced me to the world of interview problems. Has 150+ problems that will put you ahead of other candidates.
Elements of Programming Interviews Python
How much I&amp;rsquo;d Recommend it - 10/10
A book of even more problems than CTCI, AND they’re harder. I solved a lot of problems in this book, and I can easily say it helped on my interviews.</description>

      <description>Last Updated: July 5th, 2021I’m currently living and working in Orlando. Being vaccinated means I can start shifting my old hobbies of being inside all day to having more social opportunities.
Working Full Time
I’ve been working as a developer at Citibank for a year. I’m also trying to solve every problem in the ELPI book. I think I’m at about 50 out of 200.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that special, wonderful time of the year. Thousands of students wake up each month with a mixed sense of anxiety and excitement. When their classes end, they&amp;rsquo;ll go home and hear about how their friends got accepted into Duke and MIT, then they&amp;rsquo;ll schizophrenically debate with themselves whether they should check or not if they got into their dream school. I mean, if Thomas got in, then why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they?</description>

      <description>Every year, I write a reflection on my birthday year. And generally, they all say, “this year was great and I love my friends”. That isn’t happening today. Today’s my 22nd birthday. The past year has easily been one of my worst, but don’t get me wrong, the past 3 months were some of the best of my life. I’m thankful for the interns I met. And I’m even more thankful for all my friends who I could spend time with on my birthday.</description>

      <description>Another post from the articles. This is a chapter from my life, probably when I was 17 in 2015. It&amp;rsquo;s not super-polish and it might be one of my least favorite thigns I&amp;rsquo;ve writte. That said, I might as well leave it online for a little bit. I think I could edit it to have it be better.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing video games for a really long time. I spent a lot of time during my childhood with my grandma, because my mom worked.</description>

      <description>When I tell my smart and studious IB friends that I want to take a break from college for a year, they look at me with a confused face. &amp;ldquo;Why on Earth would you do that!&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s like I just took a crap on their lawn. And their reactions make sense; I&amp;rsquo;ve spent three years in a program designed to give me skills for college. Why would I not want to jump in?</description>
